# Sentiment Analysis for Movie Reviews

Sentiment Analysis research has become very popular in the past years especially thanks to the large amount of information available online.
With the advent of the social web, opinions have become really common and thanks to that, product review mining has become a really important area of reasearch in Natural Language Processing.
The idea behind this project is to create a robust and reliable model that is able to classify in the best possible way the polarity of movie reviews.
This is done in through two main tasks:

- Subjectivity/Objectivity detection, checks whether a sentence has some subjective components within it or not.
- Polarity classification, checks whether a text has a negative or positive connotation.
